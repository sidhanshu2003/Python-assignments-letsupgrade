ASSIGNMENT-1 (Python Essentials Batch-6 Day-1)

Python is a programming language founded by Guido Van Rossum in 1991.

1. Developers can learn easily
2. Involves less code compared to other languages like Java

Can we downloaded from python.org. But the best option is install Anaconda Navigator on Windows/MacOS machines to get access to Python along with test editors like Jupyter, IDE like Spyder along with all Python Libraries.


2. What are Code Environments? Types?
Code environment is contained environment where we are write code, compile code & see the output

There are 3 types of Code environments
1. Text Editors 
2. Full IDE

Sublime, Visual Studio code

Full IDE 
Spyder for Python, Eclipse IDE for Java

Noteook environments - Jupyter
